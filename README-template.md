## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Time spent

CSS : 1-2hours
JS : 4hours -

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- .includes - a great function for checking lists of arrays in if statements
- remove() - to remove an item from its own parent element
- Go to practice alot of looping for this project

### Continued development

Need to use ChatGPT for less support- i used it alot to help me with creating my JS for making the filters appear in the filter box. But I did manage to use the knowlage i learnt from that to then develop the code for clicking the X to remove the filter.

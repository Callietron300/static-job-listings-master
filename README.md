## My process 🎨

### Time spent ⏳

CSS : 1-2hours
JS : 7+hours

### Built with 🏗

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned 🤓

- `.includes()` - a great function for checking lists of arrays in if statements
- `.remove()` - to remove an item from its own parent element
- Practice alot of looping for this project & more condiationals

### Continued development 🤔

- **Use chat GPT Less**- i used it alot to help me with creating my JS for making the filters appear in the filter box. Hopefully with more practice ill rely on it less.
- **Better function naming** - I used the word filter alot in my function naming and i think it should spend a bit more time being thoughtful about function names
- **Add event handlers to parents** - i learnt this later on and was too deep to make the changes for this project. I was using `.forEach()` to cycle through lists of elements.
- **Smaller functions** - my functions where too big

I want to try to learn more about the following:

- Arrow functions
- Simplifying conditional statements
- maps
- chaining methods
- Animations
